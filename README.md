# BANK BUILT ON ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN USING SOLIDITY ✅


Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank Project

Welcome to the Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project! In this project, we have developed a decentralized and secure bank application on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. Users can deposit ethers into their accounts, earn real-time interest, and withdraw funds whenever they need, all while enjoying the benefits of a secure and transparent decentralized bank.


The Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project aims to create a decentralized banking experience using the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts. This system provides users with the ability to deposit ethers into their accounts, receive real-time interest on their deposits, and withdraw funds at any time, ensuring their financial assets are secure and accessible.

Features

Depositing Ethers: Users can deposit ethers into their accounts by interacting with the smart contract.
Real-time Interest: Deposits will earn real-time interest over time, increasing the value of the user's account.
Withdrawal: Users can withdraw their funds whenever they want, ensuring flexibility and accessibility.
Decentralized: The bank operates on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating the need for a central authority and providing transparency and security.

How is it any different from running a python program on my desktop?
Of course in this primer, we’ve abstracted out a lot of jargons so that we can get to the crux of the matter. To build resilient smart contracts, it is important to understand what is really happening and understand some of the jargons.
Ethereum is a world computer. Everyone is running code on this single computer. Anyone can connect their laptop to this world computer and add a CPU to it, and make it even more powerful. There are hundreds of thousands of computers that contribute their processing power to this world computer. Each of these computers are called miner nodes.
