# BANK BUILT ON ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN USING SOLIDITY âœ…


Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank Project

Welcome to the Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project! In this project, we have developed a decentralized and secure bank application on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. Users can deposit ethers into their accounts, earn real-time interest, and withdraw funds whenever they need, all while enjoying the benefits of a secure and transparent decentralized bank.


The Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project aims to create a decentralized banking experience using the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts. This system provides users with the ability to deposit ethers into their accounts, receive real-time interest on their deposits, and withdraw funds at any time, ensuring their financial assets are secure and accessible.

Features

Depositing Ethers: Users can deposit ethers into their accounts by interacting with the smart contract.
Real-time Interest: Deposits will earn real-time interest over time, increasing the value of the user's account.
Withdrawal: Users can withdraw their funds whenever they want, ensuring flexibility and accessibility.
Decentralized: The bank operates on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating the need for a central authority and providing transparency and security.
