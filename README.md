# BANK BUILT ON ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN USING SOLIDITY âœ…


Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank Project

Welcome to the Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project! In this project, we have developed a decentralized and secure bank application on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. Users can deposit ethers into their accounts, earn real-time interest, and withdraw funds whenever they need, all while enjoying the benefits of a secure and transparent decentralized bank.


The Simple Ethereum Blockchain Bank project aims to create a decentralized banking experience using the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts. This system provides users with the ability to deposit ethers into their accounts, receive real-time interest on their deposits, and withdraw funds at any time, ensuring their financial assets are secure and accessible.

Features

Depositing Ethers: Users can deposit ethers into their accounts by interacting with the smart contract.
Real-time Interest: Deposits will earn real-time interest over time, increasing the value of the user's account.
Withdrawal: Users can withdraw their funds whenever they want, ensuring flexibility and accessibility.
Decentralized: The bank operates on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating the need for a central authority and providing transparency and security.

Depositing Ethers
Connect your Ethereum wallet or browser extension to the Ethereum network.
Deploy the smart contract to the network.
Access the user interface and navigate to the deposit section.
Enter the amount of ethers you want to deposit and confirm the transaction.
The deposited amount will be reflected in your account balance.
Earning Interest
As time passes, the deposited ethers will accumulate interest in real-time within the smart contract.
The interest earned will be automatically added to your account balance.
Withdrawing Funds
Navigate to the withdrawal section of the user interface.
Enter the amount of ethers you want to withdraw.
Confirm the transaction to withdraw funds from your account.
Smart Contracts

The project consists of the following smart contracts:

Bank: Manages user accounts, deposits, interest calculation, and withdrawals.
The solidity code for these contracts can be found in the contracts/ directory.
